\usage{
objective(par, time, status, x, boundary, theta, hessian_prev)
}
\arguments{
\item{par}{Numeric vector of parameters to be optimized, including spline
coefficients for the baseline hazard (\code{alpha}) and regression
coefficients (\code{beta}).}

\item{time}{Numeric vector of observed survival times.}

\item{status}{Numeric vector of event indicators.}

\item{x}{Numeric matrix of covariates (features) for the model.}

\item{boundary}{Numeric vector specifying the boundary knots for the splines.}

\item{theta}{Numeric vector of prior parameters for regularization.}

\item{hessian_prev}{Numeric matrix of prior Hessian for regularization.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{value}{Scalar value of the objective function.}
\item{gradient}{Numeric vector of the gradient of the objective function.}
\item{hessian}{Numeric matrix of the Hessian of the objective function.}
}
\description{
Computes the objective value, gradient, and Hessian for optimizing a Cox
proportional hazards model with spline-based baseline hazard estimation.
}
\details{
The objective function combines two components:
\itemize{
\item A regularization term based on prior parameters (\code{theta}) and prior Hessian
(\code{hessian}).
\item A likelihood-based term for the Cox proportional hazards model, where the
baseline hazard is modeled using Bernstein polynomials.
}

The function calculates the loss, gradient, and Hessian for both components
and combines them to return the overall objective value, gradient, and
Hessian. The baseline hazard is integrated using helper functions
(\code{int_basehaz}) to compute cumulative hazard and its derivatives.
