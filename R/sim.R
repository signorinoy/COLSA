#' Simulated Survival Data with Mixed Covariates
#'
#' This dataset was generated for a simulation study to evaluate survival models
#' incorporating both continuous and categorical covariates.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 6,000 rows and 10 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{id}{Integer identifier for each subject.}
#'   \item{time}{Observed event or censoring time.}
#'   \item{status}{Event indicator: 1 for event, 0 for right-censored.}
#'   \item{x1}{First continuous covariate, generated from a bivariate normal distribution.}
#'   \item{x2}{Second continuous covariate, also from the bivariate normal distribution.}
#'   \item{x31}{First binary categorical covariate, generated from a Bernoulli distribution.}
#'   \item{x42}{Dummy variable for level 2 of the second categorical covariate (reference is level 1).}
#'   \item{x43}{Dummy variable for level 3 of the second categorical covariate.}
#'   \item{x44}{Dummy variable for level 4 of the second categorical covariate.}

#' @details
#' The two continuous covariates \code{x1} and \code{x2} were independently drawn
#' from a bivariate normal distribution. The binary covariate \code{x31} was
#' generated from a Bernoulli distribution. The second categorical covariate
#' had four levels and was drawn from a multinomial distribution, conditional on
#' \code{x31}. The final covariates \code{x42}–\code{x44} are dummy variables representing
#' levels 2–4 (level 1 is the reference).
#'
#' Event times were generated from a mixture of two Weibull distributions with
#' shape parameters 3 and 5, and scale parameters 10 and 20, respectively.
#' Right censoring was imposed using censoring times drawn from an exponential
#' distribution with rate 3.
#'
#' The true regression coefficients were:
#' \deqn{\boldsymbol{\beta} = (0.15, -0.15, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3)^\top}
#'
#' The complete dataset includes six subsets: the first three contain 1,500
#' observations each, and the remaining three contain 500 each. These subsets are
#' indicated by the \code{group} variable.
